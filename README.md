## Introduction

The NWU Tech Trends Management System is designed to track the time saved by automation processes developed by Tech Trends. This time is associated with a cost and grouped by project and client. The system uses telemetry embedded in automation, recorded via a RESTful API whenever the automation runs.

## Features

- **CRUD RESTful API**: Manage telemetry data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Telemetry Tracking**: Record time saved and associated costs for each automation run.
- **Project and Client Grouping**: Aggregate telemetry data by project and client for detailed insights.
