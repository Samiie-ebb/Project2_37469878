## Introduction

The NWU Tech Trends Management System is designed to track the time saved by automation processes developed by Tech Trends. This time is associated with a cost and grouped by project and client. The system uses telemetry embedded in automation, recorded via a RESTful API whenever the automation runs.

## Features

- **CRUD RESTful API**: Manage telemetry data with Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Telemetry Tracking**: Record time saved and associated costs for each automation run.
- **Project and Client Grouping**: Aggregate telemetry data by project and client for detailed insights.

## API Endpoints

### Base URL
http://your-api-base-url.com/api

## How to use

1. **Start the Application**:
   After you’ve installed the app, start it up. The app will run locally on your computer.

2. **Access the API**:
   You’ll interact with the app via an API. Use a tool like Postman or Curl to send requests to the API endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api`.

3. **Track Your Automation**:
   The app allows you to:
   - **Add New Records**: Input details about a new automation run, including how much time was saved and the cost.
   - **Update Existing Records**: Modify details of any previously added automation records.
   - **View Records**: Check all the records to see the time saved and costs associated with your automations.
   - **Delete Records**: Remove any records that are no longer needed.

4. **Monitor and Manage**:
   Regularly use the app to keep your records up-to-date and review the data to understand the impact of your automations.
